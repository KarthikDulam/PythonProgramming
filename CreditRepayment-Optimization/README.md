# Credit Repayment Optimization

This project implements an optimization algorithm to suggest minimum payment for credit cards based on the Linear Programming approach. 

The values suggested by the tool are similar to what we get if use excel solver to minimize payments by maximizing impacts. 

I am still actively working on this project and next step is to expose the functionality as a REST API so that it can be integrated with any platform. 
Currently, researching on the frameworks to implementing it. However, strongly considering FASTAPI due to lightweight design.
